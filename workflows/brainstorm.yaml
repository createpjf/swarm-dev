name: Brainstorm Pipeline
description: Generate ideas, evaluate feasibility, and produce a ranked proposal

steps:
  - id: ideate
    agent: planner
    prompt: |
      Brainstorm creative approaches for: {{task}}

      Generate at least 5 distinct ideas. For each:
      1. Brief description
      2. Key advantages
      3. Potential challenges

  - id: evaluate
    agent: executor
    prompt: |
      Evaluate the feasibility of each idea:

      ## Ideas
      {{ideate.result}}

      For each idea, assess:
      - Technical complexity (low/medium/high)
      - Time to implement
      - Risk factors
      - Impact potential

      Rank them from most to least promising.
    depends_on: [ideate]

  - id: propose
    agent: reviewer
    prompt: |
      Create a final proposal based on the evaluation:

      ## Brainstorm Ideas
      {{ideate.result}}

      ## Feasibility Evaluation
      {{evaluate.result}}

      Write a concise proposal recommending the top 1-2 approaches.
      Include an implementation roadmap and success criteria.
