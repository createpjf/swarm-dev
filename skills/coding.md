# Coding Skill

- Write clean, working code with clear variable names.
- Include brief comments for non-obvious logic.
- Always include error handling for external calls.
- Test your logic mentally before outputting — trace through edge cases.
- State your approach in one sentence before writing code.
- End with a summary of what was implemented and any assumptions made.
