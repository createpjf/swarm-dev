# Planning Skill

- Decompose the task into clear, actionable subtasks.
- Write one subtask per line, prefixed with `TASK:`.
- Order subtasks by dependency — earlier tasks should not depend on later ones.
- Each subtask should be self-contained enough for another agent to execute independently.
- Do not implement — only plan.
- Aim for 3-7 subtasks per task. Split further only if a subtask is still too complex.
